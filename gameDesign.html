      gameConfig.js file. This config contain information about game resolution, input configuration, a list of scenes
      which are used is the game code. Phaser configuration also contains background color and physics configuration.
      loadingScene - is a first scene which is loaded after game start. This scene declares which resources will be
      loaded in 'prepare()' method.<br><br>
      In 'create' method the scene creates a global music sound and loads mainMenuScene. In this scene player can start

      <li>The games uses Phaser 3 javascript engine to render images, interact with input, loading sound and
        for internal physics.</li>
      <li>Node.Js and express module used as backend.</li>

    <img src="images/classDiagramm.png" alt="" class="imageCls" />
    <p class="text">All game classes may be splitted into 2 groups:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Scene classes - handles scene logic(create UI and handle input).</li>
      <li>Game play classes - dynamic objects in the game(like fruits and bombs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="header2">Game classes:</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>basicObj - a sliceable object, hanldes touches by player and calls virtual method slice.</li>
      <li>fruitObj - a fruit - increases player score on slice and splits into two parts. If fruit will be invisible,
        lives count of player is decreased.</li>
      <li>bombObj - a bomb - decreases player lives count on slice.</li>
      <li>spawner - a class attended to spawn bombs and fruits from bottom of the screen.</li>
      <li>button - a class representing UI button, consist of Phaser image and Phaser text.
        handles user input and calls user defined callback on button press.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="header2">Scene classes:</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>loadingScene - the first scene loaded after the game start, does not based on backgroundScene.

      </li>
      <li>backgroundScene - is the base class for the all scenes exluding loadingScene. This class is just creates a
        background image in create() virtual method of Phaser.Scene.

      </li>
      <li>topScoresMenu - class for the top scores menu. When this scene starts browser sends a get request to the
        server. Node.JS responses with the sorted top scored players. After the response scene shows top players list.

        scene. State could be inGame, paused and gameover. Different buttons are shown on the screen depending on the
        game state. gameplayBaseScene starts 2 timers, one for a fruit spawn and the second is for bomb. Time depends on
        game difficulty configuration
      </li>
      <li>singlePlayerScene - This class is based on gameplayBaseScene. The scene creates a single instance of player
        structure and a single pointer(only mouse or single touch). Scene also creates an instance of spawner class. The
        class implements virtual callbacks for the timers to spawn fruits and bombs. When the player is lost all his
        lives the scene shows game over menu. The scene pushes player score to the server database after game over.
